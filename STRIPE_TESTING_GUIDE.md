# Stripe Integration Testing Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for testing the Stripe integration in the MindWell application. It covers all payment flows, subscription management, and troubleshooting tips.

## üîë Prerequisites

Before testing, ensure you have:

1. Set up your environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key_here
   VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key_here
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
   ```

2. Configured Stripe webhook endpoints in your Stripe Dashboard:
   - URL: `https://your-domain.com/functions/v1/stripe-webhook`
   - Events to listen for:
     - `payment_intent.succeeded`
     - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
     - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
     - `customer.subscription.updated`
     - `customer.subscription.deleted`

## üß™ Test Cards

Use these Stripe test cards to simulate different payment scenarios:

| Card Number | Scenario |
|-------------|----------|
| 4242 4242 4242 4242 | Successful payment |
| 4000 0000 0000 0002 | Declined payment |
| 4000 0025 0000 3155 | 3D Secure authentication |
| 4000 0000 0000 9995 | Insufficient funds |
| 4000 0000 0000 9987 | Lost card |
| 4000 0000 0000 9979 | Stolen card |

For all test cards:
- Expiration date: Any future date (e.g., 12/30)

   - Choose a subscription service
   - Complete checkout with test card

2. **Manage subscription**:
   - Go to Subscriptions page
   - Verify subscription details
   - Test pause/resume functionality

   - Book a new appointment
   - Verify it uses subscription quota instead of charging

### 6. Cancellation & Refunds

1. **Cancel appointment**:
   - Find an upcoming appointment
   - Click menu and select "Cancel"
   - Review cancellation policy
   - Complete cancellation

2. **Process refund (as therapist)**:

   - Complete rescheduling

2. **Verify rescheduled appointment**:

   - Confirm new appointment appears with correct details
   - Verify "Rescheduled from" note

## üîç Webhook Testing

To test webhooks locally:

1. Install the Stripe CLI: https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli
2. Run webhook forwarding:
   ```
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:54321/functions/v1/stripe-webhook
   ```
3. Note the webhook signing secret and add it to your `.env`
4. Trigger webhook events:
   ```
   stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
   ```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Payment fails with "Authentication Required"**:
   - This is expected with 3D Secure test cards
   - Follow the authentication prompt to complete payment

2. **Webhook errors**:
   - Check webhook signing secret is correct
   - Verify endpoint URL is accessible
   - Check Stripe Dashboard for webhook delivery attempts

3. **Stripe Connect issues**:
   - Ensure you're using test mode in Stripe Dashboard
   - Complete all required fields in onboarding
   - Check for error messages in browser console

4. **Subscription not activating**:
   - Verify webhook for `invoice.payment_succeeded` is configured
   - Check Stripe Dashboard for subscription status
   - Ensure database is updated via webhook handler

### Debugging Tools

1. **Stripe Dashboard**: View payments, subscriptions, and webhook events
2. **Stripe CLI**: Test webhooks and trigger events
3. **Browser Console**: Check for API errors
4. **Supabase Dashboard**: Examine database records and Edge Function logs

## üîí Security Considerations

- All API keys in this guide are for test mode only
- Never expose Stripe secret keys in client-side code
- Always use Stripe Elements for secure payment collection
- Process all payments server-side via Edge Functions
- Validate all webhook signatures
