# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project based on `.env.example` and fill in your credentials:

```
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here

# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key_here
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here

# OpenAI Configuration
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# ElevenLabs Configuration (for Edge Functions)
ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=your_elevenlabs_agent_id_here
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here

# Twilio Configuration (for Edge Functions)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number_here
```

**Important Notes for Supabase**:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` can be found in your Supabase project settings under API.
- For Edge Functions, you'll need to set `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (or `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for admin functions) as Supabase Secrets.

### 4. Database Setup

The database schema is defined in the `supabase/migrations` directory. You can apply these migrations to your Supabase project.

**Key Tables**:
- `profiles`: User profiles, roles, and contact info.
- `journal_entries`: Patient journal data.
- `mood_entries`: Patient mood tracking.
- `therapist_profiles`: Therapist-specific details.
- `therapist_services`: Services offered by therapists (one-time, subscriptions).
- `appointments`: Scheduled sessions.
- `messages`: Direct messages between users.
- `chat_history`: AI chat logs.
- `crisis_events`: Logs of detected crisis indicators.
- `patient_subscriptions`: Tracks patient subscriptions to therapist services.
- `payment_refunds`: Records of processed refunds.

### 5. Deploy Supabase Edge Functions

The application relies on several Supabase Edge Functions. You'll need to deploy these from the `supabase/functions` directory.

- `cancel-subscription`

- `media-stream`
- `place-call`
- `process-refund`
- `reschedule-appointment`
- `stripe-connect-onboard`
- `stripe-connect-status`
- `stripe-webhook`
- `twiml`

**Important for Edge Functions**:
- Ensure your `.env` variables (especially Stripe, Twilio, ElevenLabs keys) are also set as Supabase Secrets in your Supabase project.
- For `stripe-webhook`, you'll need to configure a webhook endpoint in your Stripe Dashboard pointing to your deployed `stripe-webhook` Edge Function URL. Refer to `STRIPE_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for details on required events.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
